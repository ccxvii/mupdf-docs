# Introduction

MuPDF can be used in two ways with Javascript as follows:

- With `mutool run`.
- With [mupdf.js](https://mupdfjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) package for Node and browsers.

Both ways are very similar and here we show code samples and the documentation
for both. However if a function or class is specific to only one environment,
then it is marked with the <span class="only_mutool">only&nbsp;mutool&nbsp;run</span> or <span class="only_mupdfjs">only&nbsp;mupdf.js</span> tags.
